Okay, let's break this down.

Phase 1: Blueprint Design & Iteration

1. Initial High-Level Blueprint:

Core Logic Module (TS): Define types, implement core SRS functions (getHint, update, practice, computeProgress, etc.). Pure functions, unit tested.

Backend Setup (Node/Express/TS): Basic server, PostgreSQL connection, database schema setup (migrations).

Backend API Implementation: Create endpoints (POST /cards, GET /practice, POST /practice/results), implement logic interacting with the database, potentially using adapted core logic concepts. Integration tested.

Frontend Setup (HTML/CSS/TS): Basic structure, tooling.

Frontend Feature - Card Creation: Implement UI and API integration for adding new cards.

Frontend Feature - Practice Mode (Basic): Fetch cards, display front/back, implement hint logic (client-side), add "Wrong/Hard/Easy" buttons, integrate with API.

Frontend Feature - Gesture Input: Integrate MediaPipe, webcam access, interpret gestures, connect gestures to API calls.

Browser Extension: Create manifest, content script for selection/button injection, background script/action for opening web app.

Wiring & Refinement: Implement the /add?description= route handler, test end-to-end flows, refine UI/UX.

2. First Pass - Chunking (Breaking it Down):

Chunk 1: Core Types: Define all TS types (Flashcard, AnswerDifficulty, etc.).

Chunk 2: Core getHint: Implement and test the getHint function.

Chunk 3: Core computeProgress: Implement and test computeProgress.

Chunk 4: Backend Basic Setup: Node/Express/TS project, "hello world" endpoint.

Chunk 5: DB Setup & flashcards Table: Connect to Postgres, create flashcards table via migration.

Chunk 6: POST /api/cards Endpoint (Basic): Implement API to add to flashcards table.

Chunk 7: card_buckets Table & Update POST /cards: Add card_buckets table, modify POST /cards to add entries to card_buckets (bucket 0).

Chunk 8: practice_history Table: Add practice_history table.

Chunk 9: GET /api/practice Endpoint: Implement logic to find due cards based on DB state.

Chunk 10: POST /api/practice/results Endpoint: Implement logic to update buckets and record history in DB.

Chunk 11: Frontend Basic Setup: HTML/CSS/TS scaffold.

Chunk 12: Frontend Card Creation UI: Build the form.

Chunk 13: Frontend Card Creation Logic: Connect form to POST /api/cards.

Chunk 14: Frontend Practice UI (Display): Fetch (GET /api/practice) and display card front.

Chunk 15: Frontend Practice Logic (Answer/Hint/Buttons): Show answer, implement client-side getHint, add W/H/E buttons, connect to POST /api/practice/results.

Chunk 16: Frontend Webcam & MediaPipe Setup: Request permission, basic MediaPipe integration.

Chunk 17: Frontend Gesture Interpretation: Map MediaPipe output to AnswerDifficulty.

Chunk 18: Frontend Gesture Integration: Connect gestures to POST /api/practice/results.

Chunk 19: Extension Setup: Manifest, basic content script.

Chunk 20: Extension Selection & Button: Detect selection, inject button on Google Search.

Chunk 21: Extension Action: Open web app URL (/add?description=...) on button click.

Chunk 22: Frontend /add Route Handler: Pre-populate form from URL parameter.

3. Second Pass - Refining Steps (Smaller, Safer, Testable):

Let's make these steps even more granular, ensuring each results in a testable increment. We'll also clarify the core logic adaptation - the backend won't directly use the in-memory BucketMap functions, but rather implement the equivalent logic using the database.

Step 1: Core Types Definition: Define Flashcard, AnswerDifficulty, PracticeRecord, History, ComputeProgressResult interfaces/types/enums in a core-logic TS module/directory. Test: Basic instantiation/type checking.

Step 2: Core getHint Implementation: Implement the getHint function within the core logic module. Test: Unit tests covering various lettersToReveal values, spaces, empty strings.

Step 3: Core computeProgress Implementation: Implement the computeProgress function. Test: Unit tests with empty/populated BucketMap (or equivalent data structure if we adapt early) and History.

Step 4: Backend Project Setup: Initialize Node.js/Express/TypeScript project (ts-node-dev, express, typescript, @types/node, @types/express). Create a basic GET / endpoint returning "OK". Test: Run server, access / endpoint.

Step 5: PostgreSQL Integration & flashcards Table: Add pg library. Configure DB connection (e.g., using environment variables). Create a migration script (e.g., using node-pg-migrate) for the flashcards table schema. Test: Run migration, manually verify table creation in DB. Add a simple DB connection test/check endpoint.

Step 6: POST /api/cards - Basic Flashcard Creation: Implement the POST /api/cards endpoint. It should accept front, back, hint (optional), tags (optional), validate required fields, insert into the flashcards table, and return the created card (with generated ID). Test: Integration test using supertest to POST data and verify DB insertion and 201 response with correct body.

Step 7: card_buckets Table & Link to Card Creation: Create migration for card_buckets table. Modify POST /api/cards logic: wrap insertions in a transaction, insert into flashcards, then insert into card_buckets with bucket_number = 0 and the new card_id. Test: Update integration test for POST /api/cards to verify entries in both tables. Test transaction rollback on error (e.g., simulate DB error after first insert).

Step 8: practice_history Table: Create migration for practice_history table. Test: Run migration, verify table creation.

Step 9: GET /api/practice - Fetching Due Cards: Implement GET /api/practice. Query card_buckets joined with flashcards. Implement the logic: return cards where bucket_number = 0 AND last_practiced_at IS NULL OR (last_practiced_at IS NOT NULL AND CURRENT_DATE >= (last_practiced_at + interval '1 day' * power(2, bucket_number))). Test: Integration test seeding various card states (new, due, not due) and verifying the endpoint returns only the correct due cards.

Step 10: POST /api/practice/results - Updating Card State: Implement POST /api/practice/results. Accept cardId and difficulty. Validate input. Find current bucket. Calculate newBucket. Start transaction: Insert into practice_history (recording previous_bucket, new_bucket, etc.). Update card_buckets (set bucket_number = newBucket, last_practiced_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP). Commit. Return { newBucketNumber }. Test: Integration test seeding a card, calling the endpoint, verifying updates in card_buckets and new entry in practice_history. Test error cases (invalid ID, invalid difficulty).

Step 11: Frontend Project Setup: Set up a basic frontend build process (e.g., Vite with TypeScript template or manual setup with Parcel/Webpack). Create index.html, basic CSS, and main.ts. Test: Build and serve the frontend, verify the basic page loads.

Step 12: Frontend Card Creation Form: Create an HTML form in index.html (or a component if using a framework) for front, back, hint, tags. Add basic styling. Test: Verify form elements render correctly in the browser.

Step 13: Frontend Card Creation Logic: In main.ts, add event listener to the form. On submit, prevent default, gather data, use fetch to call POST /api/cards. Handle success/error responses, provide user feedback (e.g., simple alert or message on page). Test: Run backend and frontend. Use the UI to create a card. Verify network request, backend DB changes, and UI feedback.

Step 14: Frontend Practice View Structure: Create a dedicated area/element in index.html for the practice session. Add elements for card front, card back (initially hidden), hint display, and control buttons. Test: Verify the elements render.

Step 15: Frontend Fetch & Display Practice Card: Add a "Start Practice" button. On click, fetch data from GET /api/practice. Store the fetched cards array. Display the front of the first card in the designated area. Handle the case where no cards are due. Test: Run backend (with due cards seeded). Click button, verify network request and card front display.

Step 16: Frontend Show Answer, Hint Logic & Next Card (Button Prep): Implement "Show Answer" button logic to reveal the card back. Implement a "Hint" button: maintain a client-side counter lettersToReveal, call the core logic getHint function (imported/copied to frontend) on click, and display the result. Add (but don't fully wire yet) "Wrong", "Hard", "Easy" buttons. Test: Manually test showing answer and clicking hint multiple times.

Step 17: Frontend Practice Loop (Buttons): Wire up "Wrong", "Hard", "Easy" buttons. On click: Get the current cardId, determine the difficulty value, call POST /api/practice/results. On success, load the next card from the fetched array or show "Session Complete". Reset hint counter. Test: Run backend/frontend. Complete a practice session using only buttons, verify state changes in DB and UI flow.

Step 18: Frontend Webcam/MediaPipe Setup: Add MediaPipe Tasks Vision library (@mediapipe/tasks-vision). Add code to request webcam permission when practice starts (or when "Show Answer" is clicked). Handle permission grant/denial. If granted, set up HandLandmarker. Test: Verify permission prompt appears. Verify graceful fallback (e.g., enabling buttons only) if denied. Log basic confirmation if MediaPipe initializes.

Step 19: Frontend Gesture Detection Loop: After "Show Answer" and if webcam is active, start sending video frames to HandLandmarker. Process results: log detected landmarks or basic classification attempts. Display webcam feed subtly for user feedback. Test: Manually test if hand landmarks are being detected and logged in the console.

Step 20: Frontend Gesture Interpretation & Debounce: Implement logic to analyze HandLandmarker results to classify Thumbs Up (Easy), Thumbs Down (Wrong), Thumb Horizontal (Hard). Add a debounce/hold requirement (e.g., gesture must be held consistently for 0.5s). Provide visual feedback for detected/confirmed gesture. Test: Extensive manual testing with different hands/lighting to verify classification and debounce.

Step 21: Frontend Gesture Integration with API: When a gesture is confirmed, trigger the same logic as the corresponding button click (call POST /api/practice/results, move to next card/end session). Disable gesture detection for the current card once a result is submitted. Ensure buttons remain as fallbacks. Test: Complete a practice session using only gestures (where possible). Test switching between gestures and buttons.

Step 22: Extension Basic Setup: Create a directory for the extension. Add manifest.json (v3) specifying name, version, description, permissions (activeTab, scripting), and content script matching https://www.google.com/search*. Create an empty content script file (content.js). Test: Load the unpacked extension in Chrome. Verify no errors on the extensions page. Navigate to Google Search, check developer console for content script logs (add a simple console.log initially).

Step 23: Extension Selection Listener & Button Injection: In content.js, add an event listener for mouseup. Inside the listener, check if text is selected (window.getSelection()). If text is selected within a relevant part of the search results page (e.g., within specific container classes, optional refinement), inject a small button near the selection. Test: Select text on Google Search results. Verify the button appears. Test edge cases (selecting outside results, short selections).

Step 24: Extension Button Action: Add a click listener to the injected button. On click: Get the selected text. Construct the target URL: http://<your-web-app-domain>/add?description=<URL-encoded-selected-text>. Use chrome.runtime.sendMessage to ask the (currently non-existent) background script to open the tab, or directly use window.open if background script is not strictly needed yet (simpler start). Test: Click the injected button. Verify a new tab opens with the correctly formatted URL and encoded text.

Step 25: Frontend /add Route Handling: Add logic to the frontend (e.g., in main.ts or router if using one) to check window.location.search on page load. If a description query parameter exists, parse it, decode it, and pre-populate the front input field of the card creation form. Test: Manually navigate to http://<your-web-app-domain>/add?description=Test%20Text. Verify the "front" input field is pre-filled with "Test Text".

Step 26: End-to-End Extension Flow Test: Test the complete flow: Select text on Google Search -> Click injected button -> Verify new tab opens with pre-filled card creation form -> Optionally fill 'back' and save the card -> Verify card saved in DB.

Phase 2: LLM Prompts

Here are the prompts, designed to be fed sequentially to a code-generation LLM.

Prompt 1: Core Types Definition

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: We are starting the development of a Flashcard application. The first step is to define the core data structures in a dedicated TypeScript module.

Task: Create a TypeScript file `src/core-logic/types.ts`. Define the following types/interfaces/enums based on the project specification:
1.  `Flashcard`: A class with `id` (string, readonly), `front` (string, readonly), `back` (string, readonly), `hint` (string, readonly), `tags` (ReadonlyArray<string>, readonly). Include a constructor initializing all properties.
2.  `AnswerDifficulty`: An enum with values `Wrong = 0`, `Hard = 1`, `Easy = 2`.
3.  `BucketMap`: A type alias for `Map<number, Set<Flashcard>>`. (Note: While the backend might not use this directly, defining it helps conceptual clarity initially).
4.  `PracticeRecord`: A type alias for an object with `date` (Date), `card` (Flashcard), `difficulty` (AnswerDifficulty).
5.  `History`: A type alias for `Array<PracticeRecord>`.
6.  `ComputeProgressResult`: A type alias for an object with `totalCards` (number), `cardsByBucket` (Map<number, number>), `historyStats` ({ totalPractices: number; difficultyCounts: { wrong: number; hard: number; easy: number; }; }), and optionally `message` (string).

Goal: Establish the foundational types. No implementation logic needed yet. Ensure proper TypeScript syntax and export the defined types/enums/classes. Add basic JSDoc comments explaining each type. Create a placeholder test file `src/core-logic/types.test.ts` that imports these types and perhaps includes a simple instantiation test to ensure they are exported correctly and syntactically valid (e.g., `const card = new Flashcard(...)`).


Prompt 2: Core getHint Implementation & Test

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: We have defined the core types in `src/core-logic/types.ts`, including the `Flashcard` class. Now, we need to implement the first piece of core logic: generating hints.

Task:
1.  Create a file `src/core-logic/functions.ts`.
2.  Implement the `getHint` function within this file as specified:
    *   Signature: `getHint(card: Flashcard, lettersToReveal: number): string`
    *   Input: A `Flashcard` object and a non-negative integer `lettersToReveal`.
    *   Behavior:
        *   Validate `lettersToReveal` (throw Error if negative or not an integer).
        *   Iterate through the `card.back` text.
        *   Build the hint string: reveal the first `lettersToReveal` non-space characters of each word, replace subsequent non-space characters with '_'. Preserve spaces.
    *   Export the function.
3.  In a corresponding test file `src/core-logic/functions.test.ts` (or similar, using Jest/Vitest if available, otherwise basic `console.assert`), write unit tests for `getHint`:
    *   Import `Flashcard` from `types.ts` and `getHint` from `functions.ts`.
    *   Test case: `lettersToReveal = 0` (should return all underscores except spaces).
    *   Test case: `lettersToReveal = 1`.
    *   Test case: `lettersToReveal` large enough to reveal the whole string.
    *   Test case: String with multiple words.
    *   Test case: String with leading/trailing/multiple spaces.
    *   Test case: Empty `card.back` string.
    *   Test case: Invalid `lettersToReveal` (negative, non-integer) - expect an error to be thrown.

Goal: Implement and thoroughly test the `getHint` function using TDD principles (write tests first or alongside). Ensure the function is pure and adheres to the specification.

Prompt 3: Core computeProgress Implementation & Test

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: We have implemented `getHint`. Now we implement the `computeProgress` function to calculate statistics. Although the backend uses the DB, this function might be useful later (e.g., for a stats dashboard).

Task:
1.  Add the `computeProgress` function to `src/core-logic/functions.ts`.
2.  Implement the function as specified:
    *   Signature: `computeProgress(buckets: BucketMap, history: History): ComputeProgressResult`
    *   Input: A `BucketMap` (Map<number, Set<Flashcard>>) and a `History` array (Array<PracticeRecord>).
    *   Behavior:
        *   Initialize a `ComputeProgressResult` object with zero counts/empty structures.
        *   Process `buckets`: Calculate `totalCards` (sum of sizes of all sets in the map). Calculate `cardsByBucket` (map of bucket number to card count in that bucket).
        *   Process `history`: Calculate `totalPractices`. Tally counts for each `AnswerDifficulty` (`wrong`, `hard`, `easy`) into `difficultyCounts`.
        *   Add an optional `message` if the input `buckets` map is empty or the `history` array is empty.
    *   Return the `ComputeProgressResult` object.
    *   Export the function.
3.  In `src/core-logic/functions.test.ts`, add unit tests for `computeProgress`:
    *   Import necessary types (`Flashcard`, `BucketMap`, `History`, `PracticeRecord`, `AnswerDifficulty`, `ComputeProgressResult`).
    *   Test case: Empty `buckets` map and empty `history`. Verify zero counts and the presence of an appropriate message.
    *   Test case: Populated `buckets` map, empty `history`. Verify correct `totalCards`, `cardsByBucket`, zero history stats, and message.
    *   Test case: Empty `buckets` map, populated `history`. Verify zero card stats, correct history stats, and message.
    *   Test case: Populated `buckets` map and populated `history` with various difficulties. Verify all fields in the result are calculated correctly. Use dummy `Flashcard` objects (only `id` might matter for set uniqueness).

Goal: Implement and test the `computeProgress` function using TDD. Ensure it correctly processes the inputs and returns the expected statistics structure.

Prompt 4: Backend Project Setup (Node/Express/TypeScript)

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: We have the initial core logic types and functions (`getHint`, `computeProgress`). Now we start setting up the backend server using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.

Task:
1.  Initialize a new Node.js project (e.g., `npm init -y`).
2.  Install necessary dependencies: `express`, `typescript`, `@types/node`, `@types/express`, `ts-node`, `ts-node-dev` (or `nodemon`), `dotenv`.
3.  Configure TypeScript: Create a `tsconfig.json` file (e.g., `npx tsc --init`) and customize it for a Node.js Express project (e.g., set `outDir`, `rootDir`, `module`, `target`, `esModuleInterop`, `sourceMap`). Ensure `rootDir` includes the `src` directory where code will live.
4.  Create a basic server structure:
    *   `src/server.ts` (or `src/index.ts`): Entry point. Sets up Express app, defines port (use `process.env.PORT`), adds basic middleware (like `express.json()`), and starts the server.
    *   Define a simple `GET /` route that returns a 200 status and a JSON body `{ "status": "OK" }`.
5.  Add scripts to `package.json` for running the server:
    *   `build`: `tsc`
    *   `start`: `node dist/server.js` (or `dist/index.js`)
    *   `dev`: `ts-node-dev src/server.ts` (or `nodemon --watch 'src/**/*.ts' --exec 'ts-node' src/server.ts`)
6.  Create a `.env` file for environment variables (like `PORT=3000`) and a `.gitignore` file (include `node_modules`, `dist`, `.env`).

Goal: Set up a runnable Node.js/Express/TypeScript backend project. The server should start, and a request to `GET /` should return a success response. Implement basic structure and necessary configurations. Add a simple test (manual curl/browser access or using a tool like `curl localhost:3000/`) to verify the server runs and the `/` endpoint works.

Prompt 5: PostgreSQL Integration & flashcards Table

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: We have a basic Node.js/Express/TS backend server running. The next step is to integrate PostgreSQL and create the first database table (`flashcards`).

Task:
1.  Install PostgreSQL client library: `npm install pg @types/pg`.
2.  Install a migration tool: `npm install -D node-pg-migrate`.
3.  Configure Database Connection:
    *   Add database connection details (user, host, database, password, port) to the `.env` file (e.g., `DB_USER`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_PORT`).
    *   Create a database configuration module (e.g., `src/db/config.ts`) that reads these variables from `process.env` and potentially exports a `pg.Pool` instance or connection configuration object. Ensure sensitive details are not hardcoded.
4.  Set up `node-pg-migrate`:
    *   Add configuration for `node-pg-migrate` (e.g., in `package.json` or a dedicated config file) to use the connection details from `.env`.
    *   Add scripts to `package.json` for running migrations: e.g., `migrate:create`: `node-pg-migrate create -- T`, `migrate:up`: `node-pg-migrate up`, `migrate:down`: `node-pg-migrate down`.
5.  Create the first migration:
    *   Run `npm run migrate:create -- create_flashcards_table`.
    *   Edit the generated migration file to define the `flashcards` table schema as specified: `id` (UUID, primary key, default gen_random_uuid()), `front` (TEXT, not null), `back` (TEXT, not null), `hint` (TEXT, nullable), `tags` (TEXT[], nullable), `created_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP). Ensure the `uuid-ossp` extension is enabled if using `gen_random_uuid()` (add `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";` in the migration or ensure it's enabled in the DB).
6.  (Optional but Recommended) Add a simple health check endpoint (e.g., `GET /health/db`) in `src/server.ts` that attempts a basic query (like `SELECT NOW()`) using the configured pool to verify the DB connection is working.

Goal: Integrate PostgreSQL, set up migrations, create the `flashcards` table schema, and optionally add a DB health check. Run `npm run migrate:up` to apply the migration. Manually verify the table exists in your PostgreSQL database. Test the DB health check endpoint if implemented.

Prompt 6: POST /api/cards - Basic Flashcard Creation & Test

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The backend server is set up with PostgreSQL, and the `flashcards` table exists. We now need the API endpoint to create new flashcards.

Task:
1.  Install testing dependencies: `npm install -D supertest @types/supertest jest @types/jest ts-jest` (or Vitest). Configure Jest/Vitest for TypeScript.
2.  Create an API router (e.g., `src/routes/api.ts`) and mount it under `/api` in `src/server.ts`.
3.  Implement the `POST /api/cards` endpoint logic within the API router:
    *   Accept a JSON body with `front` (string), `back` (string), `hint` (string, optional), `tags` (array of strings, optional).
    *   Validate that `front` and `back` are present and non-empty. If invalid, return a 400 Bad Request response with a meaningful JSON error message (e.g., `{ "message": "Missing required fields: front and back." }`).
    *   If valid, connect to the database using the configured pool.
    *   Execute an SQL INSERT statement into the `flashcards` table, providing the input values (handle optional `hint` and `tags`, defaulting them if necessary, e.g., `hint` to null or empty string, `tags` to null or empty array `{}`). Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Use the `RETURNING *` clause (or `RETURNING id, front, back, hint, tags, created_at`) to get the newly inserted row data, including the generated `id`.
    *   Send a 201 Created response with the complete flashcard object (including the generated `id` and `created_at`) as the JSON body.
    *   Implement basic error handling for database operations (e.g., catch errors, log them, return a 500 Internal Server Error with a generic JSON message `{ "message": "Error creating flashcard." }`).
4.  Write an integration test for this endpoint (e.g., in `src/routes/api.test.ts`):
    *   Use `supertest` to make a POST request to `/api/cards` with valid data.
    *   Assert the response status is 201.
    *   Assert the response body contains the expected structure (including an `id`) and matches the input data.
    *   Optionally, connect to a *test database* and verify the record was actually inserted.
    *   Test the validation: send requests missing `front` or `back` and assert a 400 response with the correct error message.

Goal: Implement the card creation endpoint with validation, database insertion, and proper response codes/bodies. Ensure it's covered by integration tests, including success and validation failure cases. Use parameterized queries.

Prompt 7: card_buckets Table & Link to Card Creation & Test

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The `POST /api/cards` endpoint successfully creates entries in the `flashcards` table. Now, we need to introduce the `card_buckets` table to track the learning state (initially bucket 0) and link it during card creation using a transaction.

Task:
1.  Create a new migration: `npm run migrate:create -- create_card_buckets_table`.
2.  Edit the migration file to define the `card_buckets` table schema as specified:
    *   `card_id` (UUID, primary key, references `flashcards(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE).
    *   `bucket_number` (INTEGER, not null, CHECK `bucket_number >= 0`).
    *   `updated_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP).
    *   `last_practiced_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ, nullable).
    *   Add specified indexes: `idx_card_buckets_bucket_number` on `bucket_number` and `idx_card_buckets_last_practiced` on `last_practiced_at`.
3.  Run `npm run migrate:up` to apply the migration.
4.  Modify the `POST /api/cards` endpoint logic:
    *   Get a client from the database pool.
    *   Begin a transaction (`BEGIN`).
    *   Perform the `INSERT` into `flashcards` (using the client). Get the `id` from the result.
    *   Perform an `INSERT` into `card_buckets` using the same client, setting `card_id` to the new ID, `bucket_number` to 0, and `last_practiced_at` to `NULL`.
    *   Commit the transaction (`COMMIT`).
    *   Return the same 201 response with the flashcard data as before.
    *   Implement error handling: If any step fails, rollback the transaction (`ROLLBACK`) and return a 500 error. Ensure the client is released back to the pool in all cases (success or error).
5.  Update the integration test for `POST /api/cards`:
    *   After successfully creating a card via the API, query the *test database* directly to verify that a corresponding record exists in `card_buckets` with the correct `card_id` and `bucket_number = 0`.
    *   (Optional but good) Add a test case that simulates a failure during the second insert (into `card_buckets`) and verifies that the transaction is rolled back (i.e., the entry in `flashcards` is also removed or never committed). This might require mocking the DB client.

Goal: Create the `card_buckets` table and update the card creation endpoint to atomically insert into both `flashcards` and `card_buckets` (in bucket 0) using a database transaction. Update integration tests to verify this atomicity and the state of both tables.

Prompt 8: practice_history Table Migration

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: We have `flashcards` and `card_buckets`. We need the `practice_history` table to log practice attempts before implementing the endpoints that use it.

Task:
1.  Create a new migration: `npm run migrate:create -- create_practice_history_table`.
2.  Edit the migration file to define the `practice_history` table schema as specified:
    *   `id` (UUID, primary key, default gen_random_uuid()).
    *   `card_id` (UUID, not null, references `flashcards(id)` ON DELETE CASCADE).
    *   `practice_date` (TIMESTAMPTZ, default CURRENT_TIMESTAMP).
    *   `difficulty` (INTEGER, not null - representing `AnswerDifficulty` 0, 1, or 2).
    *   `previous_bucket` (INTEGER, nullable - can be null if it was the first practice).
    *   `new_bucket` (INTEGER, not null).
    *   Add the specified index: `idx_practice_history_card_id` on `card_id`.
3.  Run `npm run migrate:up` to apply the migration.

Goal: Create the `practice_history` table schema via a database migration. Verify the table and its columns/indexes exist in the database after running the migration. No API logic changes needed in this step.

Prompt 9: GET /api/practice - Fetching Due Cards & Test

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: We have all necessary tables (`flashcards`, `card_buckets`, `practice_history`). Now, implement the API endpoint to retrieve flashcards that are due for practice today based on their bucket and last practiced date.

Task:
1.  Implement the `GET /api/practice` endpoint in `src/routes/api.ts`.
2.  Logic:
    *   Connect to the database.
    *   Execute a SQL query that joins `flashcards` and `card_buckets` on `flashcards.id = card_buckets.card_id`.
    *   The `WHERE` clause should select cards that meet the practice criteria:
        *   (`bucket_number = 0 AND last_practiced_at IS NULL`)
        *   OR
        *   (`last_practiced_at IS NOT NULL AND CURRENT_DATE >= (last_practiced_at + CAST(power(2, bucket_number) || ' days' AS INTERVAL))`)
        *   *(Note: Ensure the interval calculation syntax is correct for PostgreSQL. `power(2, bucket_number)` gives the interval length in days. Casting to INTERVAL might be needed.)*
    *   Select all necessary fields from the `flashcards` table (`id`, `front`, `back`, `hint`, `tags`).
    *   Return a 200 OK response with the resulting array of flashcard objects. Return an empty array `[]` if no cards are due.
    *   Handle potential database errors with a 500 response.
3.  Write integration tests for `GET /api/practice`:
    *   Set up a *test database* with prerequisite data:
        *   Card A: New card (in `flashcards`, `card_buckets` entry with bucket 0, `last_practiced_at` is NULL). Should be returned.
        *   Card B: Practiced today, moved to bucket 1. `last_practiced_at` is today. Interval is 2^1=2 days. Should *not* be returned.
        *   Card C: Practiced 3 days ago, in bucket 1. `last_practiced_at` is 3 days ago. Interval is 2 days. Due date was yesterday. Should be returned.
        *   Card D: Practiced 7 days ago, in bucket 2. `last_practiced_at` is 7 days ago. Interval is 2^2=4 days. Due date was 3 days ago. Should be returned.
        *   Card E: Practiced 1 day ago, in bucket 3. `last_practiced_at` is 1 day ago. Interval is 2^3=8 days. Should *not* be returned.
    *   Use `supertest` to call `GET /api/practice`.
    *   Assert the response status is 200.
    *   Assert the response body is an array containing only the expected cards (A, C, D in the example) and not the others (B, E). Check the number of items and potentially their IDs.

Goal: Implement the API endpoint to correctly fetch due flashcards based on the specified spaced repetition logic using PostgreSQL date/interval functions. Cover the logic with integration tests using carefully seeded test data representing different states.

Prompt 10: POST /api/practice/results - Updating Card State & Test

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: We can now fetch due cards (`GET /api/practice`). Next, we need the endpoint to record the result of a practice trial and update the card's bucket accordingly.

Task:
1.  Implement the `POST /api/practice/results` endpoint in `src/routes/api.ts`.
2.  Logic:
    *   Accept a JSON body: `{ "cardId": "string", "difficulty": 0 | 1 | 2 }`.
    *   Validate input: Check if `cardId` (valid UUID format) and `difficulty` (0, 1, or 2) are present and valid. Return 400 Bad Request if invalid.
    *   Get a client from the DB pool.
    *   Start a transaction (`BEGIN`).
    *   Fetch the current `bucket_number` for the given `cardId` from `card_buckets` (using the client). If the card is not found, rollback, release client, and return 404 Not Found. Store this as `previousBucket`.
    *   Calculate `newBucket`:
        *   If `difficulty` is 0 (Wrong): `newBucket = 0`.
        *   If `difficulty` is 1 (Hard): `newBucket = Math.max(0, previousBucket - 1)`.
        *   If `difficulty` is 2 (Easy): `newBucket = previousBucket + 1`.
    *   Insert a record into `practice_history` (using the client): include `card_id`, `difficulty`, `previous_bucket` (`previousBucket`), `new_bucket` (`newBucket`). `practice_date` will default to `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.
    *   Update the record in `card_buckets` for the `cardId` (using the client): set `bucket_number = newBucket`, `last_practiced_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, `updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`.
    *   Commit the transaction (`COMMIT`).
    *   Release the client.
    *   Return a 200 OK response with JSON body: `{ "newBucketNumber": newBucket }`.
    *   Implement error handling: If any DB operation fails (after the initial fetch), rollback, release client, return 500 Internal Server Error.
3.  Write integration tests for `POST /api/practice/results`:
    *   Seed a test card in a specific bucket (e.g., bucket 1).
    *   Use `supertest` to POST a result (e.g., `cardId`, `difficulty: 2` (Easy)).
    *   Assert response status 200 and body `{ "newBucketNumber": 2 }`.
    *   Query the test DB: Verify `card_buckets` is updated (bucket = 2, `last_practiced_at` is recent). Verify `practice_history` has a new record with correct `card_id`, `difficulty=2`, `previous_bucket=1`, `new_bucket=2`.
    *   Test other difficulty levels (Wrong -> bucket 0, Hard -> stays in 0 if current=0, Hard -> moves to n-1 if current=n>0).
    *   Test error cases: Invalid `cardId` (expect 404), invalid `difficulty` (expect 400).
    *   Test transactionality (similar to Prompt 7, if feasible).

Goal: Implement the endpoint to record practice results, update card state atomically (bucket, last practiced time), and log history using transactions. Cover success paths for all difficulties and error paths (400, 404, 500) with integration tests.

Prompt 11: Frontend Project Setup

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The backend API is taking shape. Now, let's set up the frontend project structure using standard HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, possibly with a simple bundler/dev server like Vite or Parcel.

Task:
1.  Create a new directory for the frontend code (e.g., `frontend/`).
2.  Initialize a frontend project within this directory. Choose one method:
    *   **Vite (Recommended):** `npm create vite@latest frontend --template vanilla-ts` (or `react-ts`, `vue-ts` if you prefer a framework, but let's stick to vanilla TS for prompts unless specified otherwise).
    *   **Manual:** `npm init -y`, install `typescript`, `parcel` (or `webpack` + config). Create `src/` dir.
3.  Create the basic file structure:
    *   `index.html`: Main HTML file. Include a basic structure (`<head>`, `<body>`). Link to a CSS file and reference the main TypeScript entry point. Add placeholder elements like `<div id="app"></div>`.
    *   `src/main.ts`: Main TypeScript entry point. Add a simple `console.log("Frontend loaded!");` for now.
    *   `src/style.css`: Basic CSS file. Add simple styles (e.g., body margin/padding).
4.  Configure `package.json` (if manual or needed): Add scripts for `dev` (start dev server) and `build` (create production build).
5.  Ensure TypeScript is configured (`tsconfig.json`) appropriately for DOM/browser environment.

Goal: Set up a minimal, runnable frontend project using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. Running the `dev` script should launch a development server, and opening the browser should show the basic `index.html` page with the console log message.

Prompt 12: Frontend Card Creation Form UI

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: We have a basic frontend project structure. Now, let's add the HTML form for manually creating flashcards.

Task:
1.  In `frontend/index.html`, add a section dedicated to creating cards.
2.  Inside this section, create an HTML `<form id="create-card-form">`.
3.  Add the following form elements within the form:
    *   Label and `<textarea id="card-front" name="front" required></textarea>` for the front text.
    *   Label and `<textarea id="card-back" name="back" required></textarea>` for the back text.
    *   Label and `<input type="text" id="card-hint" name="hint">` for the optional hint.
    *   Label and `<input type="text" id="card-tags" name="tags">` for optional tags (user can enter comma-separated).
    *   A `<button type="submit">Create Card</button>`.
4.  In `frontend/src/style.css`, add some basic styling to make the form usable (e.g., display labels and inputs clearly, add some margins).

Goal: Create the static HTML structure and basic CSS styling for the card creation form within the frontend application. The form should render correctly in the browser, but will not have any submission logic yet.

Prompt 13: Frontend Card Creation Logic

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The card creation form UI exists in `frontend/index.html`. Now, we need to add TypeScript logic to handle form submission and call the backend `POST /api/cards` endpoint.

Task:
1.  In `frontend/src/main.ts`:
    *   Get references to the form (`#create-card-form`) and its input elements (`#card-front`, `#card-back`, etc.).
    *   Add an event listener to the form for the `submit` event.
    *   Inside the listener:
        *   Prevent the default form submission (`event.preventDefault()`).
        *   Get the values from the form inputs.
        *   Parse the tags input string into an array of strings (e.g., split by comma, trim whitespace). Handle empty tags input gracefully (empty array).
        *   Construct the request body object: `{ front: ..., back: ..., hint: ..., tags: ... }`.
        *   Use the `fetch` API to make a `POST` request to `/api/cards` (ensure the backend server URL is correct, possibly proxying in dev mode if using Vite/Webpack, or use full URL `http://localhost:3000/api/cards`).
        *   Set the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
        *   Provide the JSON stringified request body.
        *   Handle the response:
            *   Check if `response.ok` is true.
            *   If successful (e.g., status 201), display a success message to the user (e.g., using `alert()` or updating a status element on the page). Clear the form fields.
            *   If unsuccessful, parse the JSON error response (if available) or use the status text. Display an error message to the user (e.g., `alert('Error: ' + errorMessage)`).
        *   Add basic `catch` block for network errors during fetch.
2.  (Optional) Add a small area in `index.html` (e.g., `<p id="form-status"></p>`) to display success/error messages instead of using `alert()`. Update the TS logic to use this element.

Goal: Implement the client-side JavaScript (TypeScript) to capture card creation form data, send it to the backend API, and provide feedback to the user based on the API response. Test this by running both backend and frontend, creating a card via the UI, and verifying the card appears in the database and the UI shows appropriate feedback.

Prompt 14: Frontend Practice View Structure

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: Users can create cards via the UI. Now, let's set up the HTML structure for the practice session view.

Task:
1.  In `frontend/index.html`, add a new section for the practice mode (e.g., `<div id="practice-section" style="display: none;">` - initially hidden).
2.  Inside this section, add the following placeholder elements:
    *   A button to start/load the session: `<button id="start-practice-btn">Start Practice</button>`.
    *   An area to display the current card: `<div id="card-display"></div>`.
        *   Inside `card-display`, add elements for the front text: `<div id="card-front-text"></div>`.
        *   Add elements for the back text (initially hidden or empty): `<div id="card-back-text" style="display: none;"></div>`.
        *   Add an element for the hint display: `<div id="card-hint-display"></div>`.
    *   Control buttons:
        *   `<button id="show-answer-btn" style="display: none;">Show Answer</button>`.
        *   `<button id="hint-btn" style="display: none;">Hint</button>`.
        *   Feedback buttons (initially hidden):
            *   `<button id="wrong-btn" class="feedback-btn" style="display: none;">Wrong (0)</button>`
            *   `<button id="hard-btn" class="feedback-btn" style="display: none;">Hard (1)</button>`
            *   `<button id="easy-btn" class="feedback-btn" style="display: none;">Easy (2)</button>`
    *   An area for session messages: `<p id="practice-message"></p>`.
    *   (Optional) A subtle placeholder for the webcam feed: `<div id="webcam-container" style="display: none;"><video id="webcam-feed"></video></div>`
3.  In `frontend/src/style.css`, add basic styling for these new elements to position them reasonably. Ensure hidden elements are indeed hidden.

Goal: Create the static HTML structure and basic styling for the practice view, including areas for the card, hints, and controls. Elements should be present but mostly hidden or empty initially, controlled by JavaScript later.

Prompt 15: Frontend Fetch & Display Practice Card

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The HTML structure for the practice view exists. Now, add logic to fetch due cards from the backend and display the first card's front when the user starts a session.

Task:
1.  In `frontend/src/main.ts`:
    *   Get references to the new practice section elements (`#practice-section`, `#start-practice-btn`, `#card-front-text`, `#practice-message`, `#show-answer-btn`, etc.).
    *   Add a variable outside event listeners to store the fetched practice cards array (e.g., `let practiceCards: Flashcard[] = [];`) and the current card index (e.g., `let currentCardIndex: number = -1;`). (Import the `Flashcard` type from a shared location or define it if not shared).
    *   Add an event listener to the `#start-practice-btn`.
    *   Inside the listener:
        *   Optionally hide the card creation form and show the `#practice-section`.
        *   Display a "Loading..." message in `#practice-message`.
        *   Use `fetch` to call `GET /api/practice` on the backend.
        *   Handle the response:
            *   If successful and the response body (parsed JSON array) is not empty:
                *   Store the fetched cards in the `practiceCards` array.
                *   Set `currentCardIndex = 0`.
                *   Call a new function `displayCurrentCard()` (to be created).
                *   Clear the `#practice-message`.
                *   Show the `#show-answer-btn` and `#hint-btn`. Hide `#start-practice-btn`.
            *   If successful but the array is empty:
                *   Display "No cards due for practice today!" in `#practice-message`.
                *   Keep `#practice-section` visible but maybe hide card display area.
            *   If fetch fails:
                *   Display an error message in `#practice-message`.
    *   Create the `displayCurrentCard()` function:
        *   Check if `currentCardIndex` is valid and `practiceCards` has cards.
        *   Get the card: `const card = practiceCards[currentCardIndex];`.
        *   Display `card.front` in `#card-front-text`.
        *   Clear/hide `#card-back-text` and `#card-hint-display`.
        *   Ensure feedback buttons (`.feedback-btn`) are hidden and `#show-answer-btn` is visible.

Goal: Implement the logic to initiate a practice session. Fetch due cards from the backend API, store them, and display the front of the first card. Handle the cases of having cards due, no cards due, and API errors.

Prompt 16: Frontend Show Answer, Hint Logic & Next Card (Button Prep)

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The frontend can fetch and display the front of the first practice card. Now, implement the "Show Answer" functionality and the client-side "Hint" feature.

Task:
1.  In `frontend/src/main.ts`:
    *   Import the `getHint` function from your core logic module (you might need to copy/adapt `core-logic/functions.ts` and `core-logic/types.ts` into the frontend project, e.g., under `frontend/src/core/`, or set up a shared workspace if using a monorepo). Ensure the `Flashcard` type is available.
    *   Add a variable to track the hint level for the current card: `let lettersToReveal: number = 0;`. Reset this in `displayCurrentCard()`.
    *   Get references to `#show-answer-btn`, `#card-back-text`, `#hint-btn`, `#card-hint-display`, and the feedback buttons (`.feedback-btn`).
    *   Add an event listener to `#show-answer-btn`:
        *   Inside the listener:
            *   Get the current card (`practiceCards[currentCardIndex]`).
            *   Display `card.back` in `#card-back-text` and make the element visible.
            *   Hide `#show-answer-btn`.
            *   Show the feedback buttons (`#wrong-btn`, `#hard-btn`, `#easy-btn`).
            *   (Prepare for gestures/webcam if applicable, e.g., call a function `activateCardFeedbackPhase()`).
    *   Add an event listener to `#hint-btn`:
        *   Inside the listener:
            *   Increment `lettersToReveal`.
            *   Get the current card (`practiceCards[currentCardIndex]`).
            *   Call `getHint(card, lettersToReveal)` using the imported function.
            *   Display the returned hint string in `#card-hint-display`.
    *   Modify `displayCurrentCard()`:
        *   Ensure `lettersToReveal` is reset to 0.
        *   Ensure `#card-back-text` is hidden.
        *   Ensure `#card-hint-display` is cleared.
        *   Ensure feedback buttons are hidden and `#show-answer-btn` / `#hint-btn` are visible (and enabled).

Goal: Implement the "Show Answer" button logic to reveal the back of the card and show feedback controls. Implement the "Hint" button logic using the core `getHint` function to progressively reveal the answer on the client side. Reset hint state when a new card is displayed.

Prompt 17: Frontend Practice Loop (Buttons)

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The frontend can show the front/back and hints for a practice card. Now, wire up the "Wrong", "Hard", "Easy" buttons to send the results to the backend and advance to the next card or end the session.

Task:
1.  In `frontend/src/main.ts`:
    *   Get references to the feedback buttons (`#wrong-btn`, `#hard-btn`, `#easy-btn`) if not already done.
    *   Define a function `handleFeedback(difficulty: AnswerDifficulty)` (import `AnswerDifficulty` enum from core types).
    *   Inside `handleFeedback`:
        *   Get the current card: `const card = practiceCards[currentCardIndex];`. If none, return.
        *   Disable all feedback buttons temporarily to prevent double clicks.
        *   Construct the request body: `{ cardId: card.id, difficulty: difficulty }`.
        *   Use `fetch` to make a `POST` request to `/api/practice/results`. Include `Content-Type: application/json` header and the JSON body.
        *   Handle the response:
            *   If successful (`response.ok`):
                *   Increment `currentCardIndex`.
                *   Check if `currentCardIndex < practiceCards.length`.
                    *   If yes: Call `displayCurrentCard()` to show the next card.
                    *   If no: Call a new function `endPracticeSession()`.
            *   If unsuccessful:
                *   Display an error message (e.g., in `#practice-message`).
                *   Re-enable feedback buttons (or handle state more robustly).
        *   Add `catch` for fetch errors.
        *   Ensure buttons are re-enabled/state is correct if moving to the next card.
    *   Add event listeners to each feedback button (`#wrong-btn`, `#hard-btn`, `#easy-btn`) that call `handleFeedback` with the corresponding `AnswerDifficulty` value (0, 1, or 2).
    *   Create the `endPracticeSession()` function:
        *   Hide the card display area and control buttons.
        *   Display a "Practice session complete!" message in `#practice-message`.
        *   Maybe show the `#start-practice-btn` again.
        *   Reset `practiceCards = []` and `currentCardIndex = -1`.

Goal: Implement the full practice loop using the feedback buttons. Clicking a button should send the result to the backend, and upon success, either display the next card or end the session. Test the entire flow from starting practice to finishing a session with multiple cards.

Prompt 18: Frontend Webcam/MediaPipe Setup

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The core practice loop with buttons is functional. Now, let's integrate the MediaPipe Hand Landmarker for gesture input, starting with webcam access and basic setup.

Task:
1.  Install MediaPipe Tasks Vision library: `npm install @mediapipe/tasks-vision` in the `frontend` directory. Ensure the `.wasm` files are correctly served (Vite usually handles this well, check bundler config if needed).
2.  In `frontend/src/main.ts`:
    *   Import necessary components from `@mediapipe/tasks-vision` (`HandLandmarker`, `FilesetResolver`).
    *   Declare variables for `handLandmarker` instance, `runningMode` (`'VIDEO'`), webcam access status (`webcamRunning`), and potentially the video element reference (`#webcam-feed`).
    *   Create an asynchronous function `createHandLandmarker()`:
        *   Use `FilesetResolver.forVisionTasks(...)` to load the required WASM files.
        *   Call `HandLandmarker.createFromOptions()` passing the `filesetResolver` and options:
            *   `baseOptions: { modelAssetPath: 'path/to/hand_landmarker.task' }` (download the model file and place it in `public/` or similar accessible path).
            *   `runningMode: 'VIDEO'`
            *   `numHands: 1` (or 2 if needed)
    *   Create a function `enableCam(event)`:
        *   Check if `handLandmarker` is loaded. If not, alert user and return.
        *   Check if `webcamRunning` is already true, if so return.
        *   Use `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })` to request access.
        *   Handle the promise:
            *   On success (stream): Set `webcamRunning = true`, get the video element (`#webcam-feed`), set its `srcObject = stream`, add event listener for `loadeddata`, potentially show the webcam container (`#webcam-container`). In the `loadeddata` listener, start the prediction loop (call a new function like `predictWebcam()`).
            *   On failure (error): Set `webcamRunning = false`, log the error, inform the user that gestures won't be available, ensure button fallbacks are clearly visible/enabled.
    *   Call `createHandLandmarker()` once when the application loads or before practice starts to initialize the landmarker instance asynchronously.
    *   Modify the logic where feedback buttons are shown (e.g., after "Show Answer" is clicked in Prompt 16's listener, or in the potential `activateCardFeedbackPhase()` function): Call `enableCam()` here to request permission *only when needed*.

Goal: Integrate the MediaPipe Hand Landmarker library. Implement asynchronous loading of the model. Add logic to request webcam permission *when feedback is needed* (after showing the answer). Handle success (setting up video stream) and failure (logging error, ensuring fallback). Do not implement the prediction loop (`predictWebcam`) yet. Test the permission request flow and the fallback mechanism if permission is denied.

Prompt 19: Frontend Gesture Detection Loop

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: MediaPipe Hand Landmarker is initialized, and webcam access can be requested successfully, setting up the video stream. Now, implement the loop that processes video frames to detect hand landmarks.

Task:
1.  In `frontend/src/main.ts`:
    *   Ensure you have references to the video element (`#webcam-feed`).
    *   Create the `predictWebcam()` function:
        *   Check if `runningMode` is `'VIDEO'`. If not, return.
        *   Get the start time: `let startTimeMs = performance.now();`.
        *   If the video element has data (`video.currentTime !== lastVideoTime`), call `handLandmarker.detectForVideo(video, startTimeMs)`. Store the `results`.
        *   Update `lastVideoTime = video.currentTime`. (Declare `lastVideoTime` outside the function).
        *   **Crucially:** Process the `results`. For now, just log them to the console: `console.log(results);`. We will interpret them in the next step.
        *   (Optional but good practice) Draw landmarks on a canvas overlaid on the video for visual feedback, using `drawingUtils` if desired. This requires adding a `<canvas>` element.
        *   If `webcamRunning` is still true, use `window.requestAnimationFrame(predictWebcam);` to call the function again for the next frame.
    *   Modify the `enableCam` function's success handler: After the video's `loadeddata` event fires, call `predictWebcam()` to start the detection loop.
    *   Add logic to stop the loop: When feedback is submitted (in `handleFeedback` or `endPracticeSession`), set `webcamRunning = false` (this will stop `requestAnimationFrame`) and potentially stop the webcam stream (`stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());`) and hide the webcam container.

Goal: Implement the video processing loop using `handLandmarker.detectForVideo` and `requestAnimationFrame`. Log the detected hand landmark results to the console. Ensure the loop starts when the webcam is ready and stops when feedback is given or the session ends. Manually test by starting practice, showing answer, granting webcam permission, and observing the console logs for MediaPipe results when a hand is in view.

Prompt 20: Frontend Gesture Interpretation & Debounce

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The frontend now receives hand landmark data from MediaPipe in a loop. The next step is to interpret these landmarks to classify gestures (Thumbs Up/Down/Horizontal) corresponding to Easy/Wrong/Hard, adding a short hold duration for confirmation.

Task:
1.  In `frontend/src/main.ts`, modify the `predictWebcam` function's result processing part:
    *   Instead of just logging `results`, add logic to interpret `results.landmarks`.
    *   Focus on the landmarks for the thumb (tip, IP, MCP, CMC) and index finger (MCP, PIP). You'll need the specific landmark indices from MediaPipe documentation.
    *   **Gesture Logic (Example - Requires tuning):**
        *   **Thumbs Up (Easy):** Thumb tip Y coordinate significantly above (smaller value) thumb MCP Y and index finger MCP Y.
        *   **Thumbs Down (Wrong):** Thumb tip Y coordinate significantly below (larger value) thumb MCP Y.
        *   **Thumb Horizontal (Hard):** Thumb tip X coordinate significantly to the side (left/right depending on hand) of thumb MCP X, and thumb tip Y is roughly level with thumb MCP Y.
        *   *Note:* This logic is simplified. You might need to normalize coordinates, consider hand orientation, or use angles for more robustness. Start simple.
    *   **Debounce/Hold Logic:**
        *   Maintain state variables outside `predictWebcam`: `let detectedGesture: AnswerDifficulty | null = null;`, `let lastDetectedGesture: AnswerDifficulty | null = null;`, `let gestureStartTime: number = 0;`, `const requiredHoldTime = 500; // ms`.
        *   Inside `predictWebcam`, after determining the current frame's gesture (`currentFrameGesture`):
            *   If `currentFrameGesture` is the same as `lastDetectedGesture`:
                *   If `gestureStartTime === 0`, set `gestureStartTime = performance.now();`.
                *   Else if `performance.now() - gestureStartTime >= requiredHoldTime`:
                    *   Set `detectedGesture = currentFrameGesture;` (This confirmed gesture will be used).
                    *   Reset `gestureStartTime = 0;`. // Reset for next potential hold
            *   Else (gesture changed or is null):
                *   Reset `gestureStartTime = 0;`.
                *   Set `lastDetectedGesture = currentFrameGesture;`.
                *   Clear any visual feedback for confirmed gesture.
    *   **Visual Feedback:** Add simple visual feedback on the page (e.g., update text in `#practice-message` or change border color) when a gesture is *currently detected* (`lastDetectedGesture`) and when it's *confirmed* (`detectedGesture`).
    *   The *confirmed* `detectedGesture` value will be used in the next step to trigger the API call. Reset `detectedGesture = null` after it's used.

Goal: Implement logic within the prediction loop to classify hand landmarks into "Thumbs Up", "Thumbs Down", or "Thumb Horizontal". Add a timer mechanism to require the gesture to be held for ~0.5 seconds before it's considered "confirmed". Provide visual feedback. This step involves significant experimentation and tuning. Test manually with various hand positions and lighting.

Prompt 21: Frontend Gesture Integration with API

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The frontend can now detect and confirm specific hand gestures (Thumbs Up/Down/Horizontal) with a hold duration. The final step for gesture input is to trigger the appropriate action (call `POST /api/practice/results`) when a gesture is confirmed.

Task:
1.  In `frontend/src/main.ts`, modify the `predictWebcam` function:
    *   After a gesture is confirmed and `detectedGesture` is set (and is not null):
        *   Immediately call `handleFeedback(detectedGesture)`. Pass the confirmed `AnswerDifficulty` value.
        *   Reset `detectedGesture = null;` to prevent repeated calls for the same hold.
        *   Explicitly stop the gesture detection loop for this card: set `webcamRunning = false;` (this will prevent `requestAnimationFrame` from queuing the next call). You might also want to stop the video stream tracks here.
        *   Hide the webcam feed container (`#webcam-container`).
2.  Ensure the `handleFeedback` function (from Prompt 17) correctly handles being called with the `AnswerDifficulty` enum value and proceeds to call the backend API and load the next card or end the session.
3.  Ensure the fallback buttons (`#wrong-btn`, `#hard-btn`, `#easy-btn`) remain visible and functional even when the webcam/gesture detection is active, allowing the user to choose their input method. Clicking a button should also stop the webcam/gesture detection loop for that card (e.g., by setting `webcamRunning = false` at the start of `handleFeedback`).

Goal: Connect the confirmed gesture detection to the existing `handleFeedback` function. When a gesture is held and confirmed, trigger the same API call and UI update as clicking the corresponding button. Ensure the gesture detection stops once feedback is submitted (via gesture or button). Test the end-to-end flow using gestures to answer practice cards.

Prompt 22: Extension Basic Setup

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The core web application (backend and frontend with practice loop/gestures) is largely functional. Now, let's start building the Chrome browser extension to add cards from Google Search results.

Task:
1.  Create a new directory for the extension (e.g., `extension/`).
2.  Inside this directory, create the `manifest.json` file (Manifest V3):
    ```json
    {
      "manifest_version": 3,
      "name": "Flashcard Adder",
      "version": "1.0",
      "description": "Select text on Google Search to add as a flashcard front.",
      "permissions": [
        "activeTab",
        "scripting"
      ],
      "content_scripts": [
        {
          "matches": ["https://www.google.com/search*"],
          "js": ["content.js"]
        }
      ],
       "action": {
         "default_title": "Flashcard Adder (Active on Google Search)"
       }
    }
    ```
    *(Note: The `action` key provides a basic toolbar icon, though we aren't using a popup action yet. It's good practice).*
3.  Create an empty `content.js` file in the `extension/` directory. Add a simple `console.log("Flashcard Adder Content Script Loaded");` inside it.

Goal: Create the basic structure and manifest file for the Chrome extension. Load the unpacked extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/`). Navigate to a `google.com/search` results page and verify that the console log message from `content.js` appears in the DevTools console for that tab, indicating the content script is injected correctly.

Prompt 23: Extension Selection Listener & Button Injection

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The basic extension structure is set up, and the content script loads on Google Search. Now, make the content script listen for text selection and inject a button nearby.

Task:
1.  In `extension/content.js`:
    *   Remove the initial console log.
    *   Add a global variable to keep track of the injected button, if any (`let injectedButton = null;`).
    *   Add an event listener to the `document` for the `mouseup` event.
    *   Inside the `mouseup` listener:
        *   Get the current text selection: `const selectedText = window.getSelection().toString().trim();`.
        *   First, remove any previously injected button if it exists (`if (injectedButton) { injectedButton.remove(); injectedButton = null; }`).
        *   If `selectedText` is not empty:
            *   Get the selection range/bounding box (`window.getSelection().getRangeAt(0).getBoundingClientRect()`).
            *   Create a new button element: `const button = document.createElement('button');`.
            *   Set button text: `button.textContent = 'Add to Flashcards';`.
            *   Style the button: Make it small, position it absolutely or fixed near the selection (e.g., bottom right of the bounding box). Use `z-index` to ensure it's visible. Add some padding, background color, etc. (Inline styles or add a CSS file to `content_scripts` in manifest).
            *   Store the selected text on the button itself, e.g., `button.dataset.selectedText = selectedText;`.
            *   Append the button to the `document.body`.
            *   Store the reference: `injectedButton = button;`.
            *   Add a click listener to the `button` (logic for this in next step, maybe just log for now).
    *   Add a listener for `mousedown` or `selectionchange` to remove the button immediately if the user starts selecting something else or clicks away.

Goal: Implement the logic in the content script to detect when text is selected on a Google Search page. When text is selected, inject a small, styled button near the selection. Ensure only one button exists at a time and it disappears when the user clicks elsewhere or selects new text. Test by selecting various texts on Google Search results.

Prompt 24: Extension Button Action

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The extension's content script injects a button when text is selected. Now, implement the button's click action to open the web application's "add card" page with the selected text pre-filled.

Task:
1.  In `extension/content.js`, modify the button creation logic:
    *   Add a click event listener to the injected button.
    *   Inside the click listener:
        *   Retrieve the selected text stored in the button's dataset: `const text = event.target.dataset.selectedText;`.
        *   If `text` exists:
            *   URL-encode the text: `const encodedText = encodeURIComponent(text);`.
            *   Define the target URL for your web application's add page. **Crucially, hardcode your development URL for now**, e.g., `const targetUrl = \`http://localhost:5173/add?description=${encodedText}\`;` (replace `localhost:5173` with your frontend's actual dev server address/port).
            *   Open the URL in a new tab. Using `window.open(targetUrl, '_blank');` is the simplest way from a content script. (Using `chrome.tabs.create` requires sending a message to a background script, which adds complexity we can avoid for now unless necessary).
            *   Prevent the click event from propagating further if needed (`event.stopPropagation();`).
            *   Remove the button after clicking it (`event.target.remove(); injectedButton = null;`).

Goal: Implement the button's click handler to retrieve the selected text, construct the target URL for the web app's `/add` route (with the text URL-encoded in the `description` query parameter), and open this URL in a new browser tab. Test by selecting text on Google Search, clicking the button, and verifying a new tab opens with the correct URL structure and encoded text.

Prompt 25: Frontend /add Route Handling

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: The browser extension can now open the web app at a specific URL like `/add?description=...`. The final step is to make the frontend read this query parameter and pre-populate the card creation form.

Task:
1.  In `frontend/src/main.ts`:
    *   Add code that runs once when the script loads (outside any event listeners, or in an initialization function).
    *   Get the current URL's search parameters: `const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);`.
    *   Check if the `description` parameter exists: `const descriptionParam = urlParams.get('description');`.
    *   If `descriptionParam` exists (is not null or empty):
        *   Get a reference to the "front" input/textarea element of the card creation form (`#card-front`).
        *   Set the value of the "front" element to the decoded `descriptionParam`: `frontInputElement.value = decodeURIComponent(descriptionParam);`.
        *   (Optional) Focus the "back" input element to prompt the user for the next step.
2.  Ensure this code runs *after* the form elements have been rendered/parsed by the browser. If using vanilla JS/TS without a framework, place the script tag at the end of `<body>` or use a `DOMContentLoaded` listener. If using Vite/frameworks, this usually runs after DOM is ready.

Goal: Implement logic in the frontend application to check for a `description` query parameter upon page load. If found, decode it and use its value to pre-fill the "front" field of the card creation form. Test this by manually navigating to your frontend app URL with a `?description=...` query parameter (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/add?description=Hello%20World`) and verifying the form field is populated.

Prompt 26: End-to-End Extension Flow Test

Project: Flashcard App with Spaced Repetition

Context: All individual components (Backend API, Frontend Practice Loop, Frontend Add Form, Extension, Frontend `/add` Route Handler) should now be implemented.

Task: Perform an end-to-end test of the extension flow.
1.  Ensure both the backend server and the frontend development server are running.
2.  Ensure the unpacked extension is loaded and enabled in Chrome.
3.  Navigate to `https://www.google.com/search` and perform a search.
4.  Select a piece of text within the search results.
5.  Verify the "Add to Flashcards" button appears near the selection.
6.  Click the button.
7.  Verify a new tab opens to your frontend application (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/add?description=...`).
8.  Verify the "Front" text area on the card creation form is pre-filled with the text you selected on Google Search.
9.  Manually fill in the "Back" text area.
10. Click the "Create Card" button.
11. Verify you get a success message on the frontend.
12. Verify (by checking the database directly or by starting a practice session later) that the new card was successfully created in the backend database (`flashcards` and `card_buckets` tables).

Goal: Confirm that the entire workflow, from selecting text in the extension to successfully creating a pre-filled card in the web application, works as expected. Document any issues found during this test. This step doesn't require new code generation but validates the integration of previous steps.
